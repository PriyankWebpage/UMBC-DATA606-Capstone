# 2. Background

In the field of viticulture and oenology, wine quality is a critical factor in determining market value and customer happiness. Winemakers are continuously looking for ways to improve and preserve the quality of their goods. To this purpose, predictive modeling may be used to forecast wine quality based on physicochemical and sensory characteristics.

### What is it about?
The objective is to build a machine learning model capable of accurately predicting the quality of wine based on its attributes. This model can assist winemakers in assessing the quality of their products and making informed decisions regarding production and refinement processes.

### Why does it matter?

*Quality Assurance:* Predicting wine quality helps ensure consistency and maintain high standards in winemaking. By identifying factors that contribute to good or poor quality, producers can take proactive measures to maintain or improve the overall quality of their wines.

*Consumer Satisfaction:*  Wine consumers have diverse preferences and expectations regarding taste and quality. Predictive models enable producers to tailor their products to meet consumer preferences more effectively, thereby enhancing customer satisfaction and loyalty.

*Cost Optimization:* Predictive modeling can help winemakers optimize production processes and resource allocation. By identifying key factors influencing wine quality, producers can allocate resources more efficiently, reduce waste, and minimize production costs while maintaining or improving quality.

*Market Competitiveness:* In the highly competitive wine industry, maintaining consistent quality is essential for gaining a competitive edge and positioning wines effectively in the market. Predictive models provide valuable insights that can inform marketing strategies and help wineries differentiate their products based on quality.

### What are your research questions?

1. Which physicochemical and sensory attributes have the most significant impact on wine quality?

2. How do different combinations of features contribute to the overall perception of wine quality?

3. How do various machine learning algorithms compare in terms of their ability to predict wine quality accurately?

4. What is the optimal model architecture or ensemble approach for wine quality prediction?
